It seems that video is occupying our daily amusement. We watch movies, TV series, cartoon, animation, short clips and so many other motion media. As a part of these media, poster with well design always attract audience at first sight, even without seeing the actual pictures. Just like the cover of recording albums, poster highly describes the main theme and tone of the work. In addition, it takes the key scene or visual style from the whole work, display the fragment of attractive from the plots, so undoubtedly poster is something that greatly matters the whole impression of the actual work.

We see album cover art searching apps in the market, like *AlbumArtDownloader* by [alexvallat](http://sourceforge.net/users/alexvallat) and [marclandis](http://sourceforge.net/users/marclandis) and many other web-base apps. The main machanism of these apps are crawling information from shopping sites like amazon, iTunes shop and others. They parse the cover url and download it from website to display in local machine. *AlbumArtDownloader* can even classify the downloaded cover art into folders with the corresponding album's title. It's a nice example with good user experience for our project today. 

So now our team in this project aims at a poster download and classify application, **with simple media information query function and share-to-SNS features.**
